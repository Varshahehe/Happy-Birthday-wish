          I guess I've written way too many cringy things, but I can't help myself, you know. I just want to say appreciate the days you are alive on this earth and spend some time with clingy, annoying, weird, cute, adorable, jealous, overthinker, and funny people like me instead of wasting your time with others and saying that you are busy. 😂 Sorry, just kidding. Nevermind, I just want to say stop thinking about fling things and short-term relationships instead get yourself a long-term girlfriend whom you will really love. Wish you a great future ahead! 😙💞❣️

          From your one and only always giving excessive attention, Varsha! 😂💋
